Write a java code to do the implementation of linked lists. You code should have the 
following menu and corresponding functionalities.
(Your linked lists should always be sorted in increasing order. )

<b>1- Create a linked list</b>

<b>2-List all created linked lists</b>

<b>3- Insert a node to an already existing linked list</b>

(all the key values in the linked lists should be unique, to be able to do that, 
your program should show all of already existing linked lists and ask the user to choose one of them 
for insertion, then finally the user should enter a key value that should be inserted to the linked list).

<b>4-Delete a node from an already existing linked list </b>

( to be able to do that, your program sho uld show all of already existing linked lists 
and ask the user to choose one of them for deletion, then finally the user should enter 
the key value that should be deleted from the linked list).

<b>5- Search for a key value in an already existing linked list and 
return the node number</b>

( to be able to do that, your program should show all of already existing linked lists 
and ask the user to choose one of them for searching, then finally the user should 
enter a key value that should be searched in the linked list).

<b>6-Combine two already existing linked lists </b>

(to be able to do that, your program should show all of already existing linked lists 
and ask the user to choose two of them to combined together by creating a new linked list , 
the combined linked list should also be sorted).

<b>7- Find the intersection of two linked lists</b>

(to be able to do that, your program should show all of already existing linked lists 
and ask the user to choose two of them to find the intersection by creating a new linked list,
the new linked list should also be sorted).
